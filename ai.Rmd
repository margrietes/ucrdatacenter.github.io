# Introduction

AI is transforming the way we work, think, and createâ€”but are you making the most of it? 
Our **Gen AI Workshop Series**, led by Dr. Alexei Karas, is designed to help you integrate AI into your daily tasks with **practical, hands-on sessions**. 
One lunch time a week from now until Week 15, we will be exploring a **new AI use case**â€”from writing emails and brainstorming ideas to enhancing research, automating workflows, and more. 
Whether youâ€™re a beginner or already experimenting with AI, these sessions will give you the tools to **work smarter, save time, and boost your creativity**. 
We hope to see you there!
