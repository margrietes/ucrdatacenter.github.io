## Welcome to the website of the UCR Data Center!

You can find information and supplementary materials for all data
encounters in UCR courses (ongoing or past) at the bottom of this page
or via the COURSES button in the header. In addition, please see below
for other initiatives, office hours, and general tutorials.

## DC Apprenticeship

## Office hours

The Data Center student fellows hold office hours in the Data Centerâ€™s
office (Anne ground floor) to answer questions and help with assignments
related to the Data Center projects. The timing of office hours depends
