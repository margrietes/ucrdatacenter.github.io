## Welcome to the website of the UCR Data Center!

You can find information and supplementary materials for all data
encounters in UCR courses (ongoing or past) at the bottom of this page
or via the COURSES button in the header. In addition, please see below
for other initiatives, office hours, and general tutorials.

## DataFest 2024

The date is set: May 30, 2024. Then the new edition of the DataFest will
take place. A DataFest? Indeed, a hackathon, but for data-related
challenges. This time, students from the HZ University of Applied
Sciences, University College Roosevelt and Scalda will be exploring
innovative solutions together to improve mobility in Zeeland. With
various data sources regarding incoming and outgoing traffic in the
region. The focus is on predicting alternative routes, positioning
public transport hubs and understanding complex traffic patterns. The
aim is to develop concrete solutions that can improve the mobility and
flow of traffic in Zeeland.
