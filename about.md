Since 2022, the UCR Data Center (DC) has been facilitating the integration of data-related work in course assignments, internships, and student and faculty research.
In our so-called “data encounters” we introduce students from a wide range of backgrounds to working with data in the disciplinary context of UCR courses (e.g. political science, archaeology, cognitive science) with a focus on using reproducible workflows and open research software. 

Data encounters are supported by undergraduate fellows who receive academic internship credits for their work.
Our apprentices receive training in data science and research software during our intensive Apprenticeship program, and receive project guidance from the Data Center and other faculty.

In addition, the Data Center provides general data science support for the entire UCR community in the form of workshops, office hours, and online resources.
We predominantly use R and RStudio for our workshops and tutorials, and advocate for best practices throughout the research workflow, such as version control via GitHub.
We look forward to seeing you at one of our events or in our office!
