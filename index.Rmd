## Office hours

The Data Center student fellows hold office hours every Wednesday between 15:00-19:00 (15:00-17:00 with Tina, 17:00-19:00 with Bianka) on [Zoom](https://universitycollegeroosevelt.zoom.us/j/2831128718?pwd=UmRuSzVqSTZyMndDbDRGSkV5VWFVQT09) to answer questions and help with assignments related to the Data Center projects. It is also possible to have in person meeting in Anne, office 1.30 (middle floor). In case, you would like to come in person, please let the Data Center know preferably at least 2 hours before hand.
