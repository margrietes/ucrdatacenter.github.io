## Office hours

The Data Center student fellows hold office hours every Wednesday between 15:00-19:00 (15:00-17:00 with Tina, 17:00-19:00 with Bianka) in the Data Center's office (Anne 1.30 - first floor) to answer questions and help with assignments related to the Data Center projects.
If you would like to request an individual consultation or would like to attend office hours, feel free to send an email to datacenter@ucr.nl.

<!-- ## Course combinations at UCR -->

<!-- This chord diagram shows how UCR students combined tracks in the past.  -->
<!-- Every chord means that there were students who completed both tracks during their time at UCR. -->

<!-- If you hover over a track, it shows you all the other tracks that students took in combination with that track.  -->
<!-- If you hover over a chord, it shows you the number of students who completed both tracks at the endpoints of the chord. -->
