# Introduction

This page collects materials for the data-driven assignments in the Fall 2024 edition of Psycholinguistics at UCR.
You can also access the related files directly on [Github](https://github.com/ucrdatacenter/projects).

Data Center office hours will be announced soon; to schedule an individual meeting, please email [ucrdatacenter@ucr.nl](mailto:ucrdatacenter@ucr.nl).

# First workshop

The first Data Center workshop takes place on the Tuesday class of week 5 (24 September).
You can find the workshop handout [here](workshop1). Some extra materials that may or may not be covered in the workshop are available [here](workshop1extra).

To prepare for the class, please complete the following:

* read the "Setting up R" tutorial series ([link](../../tutorials))
* using the tutorials:
  + install R and RStudio
  + create a new R project for the Psycholinguistics course
  + install the `tidyverse`, `tidytext`, `childesr`, and `qdapDictionaries` packages
  
# Second workshop 

The second Data Center workshop takes place on the Tuesday class of week 6 (1 October).
You can find the workshop handout [here](workshop2).
  
# Office hours

The Data Center offers office hours to help prepare for the workshops and complete the assignments.
Please see the schedule [here](../../contact).

# Additional materials

You can find a more advanced case study that combines text analysis with regular expressions, summary statistic calculation, and data visualization [here](../archive/SCICOGN302_2023h2/workshop2).

<!-- - [Data wrangling: creating new variables](../../tutorials/r_intro_mutate) -->
<!-- - [Data wrangling: summarizing data (within groups)](../../tutorials/r_intro_summarize) -->
<!-- - [The tidy workflow](r_intro_pipe) -->
<!-- - [Data visualization: introduction to ggplot2](../../tutorials/r_ggplot_intro) -->
<!-- - [Data visualization: distributions](r_ggplot_univariate) -->

<!-- - [Working with text](r_text) -->

<!-- # Assignment guidelines -->

<!-- ## Small homework assignment -->

<!-- Use what you learned in the [first Data Center workshop](SCICOGN302_2023h2/workshop1) to complete the following assignment. -->

<!-- *The CHILDES database provides data on the use of (mostly spoken) language of a large number of young children. Use parts of the dataset to explore how the spoken language (word choice or number of words, for instance) of children changes over time . Keep you question simple, focus on a small part of the dataset (one or a few children). The chosen variable and/or sample should be different than what is shown in the Data Center workshop. Make one clear visualization of your result and briefly report on (max 200 words) , the research question and your outcome. Also briefly discuss your result in the context of scientific literature. Cite at least two papers (the latter are not part of 200 words).* -->

<!-- ## Final poster -->

<!-- If you choose to use the CHILDES database for your final poster, you can find the poster guidelines [here](SCICOGN302_2023h2/poster_guidelines). -->

<!-- # Data Center workshops -->

<!-- ## First workshop -->

<!-- The first Data Center workshop takes place on the Tuesday class of week 5. -->
<!-- To prepare for the class, please complete the following: -->

<!-- * install R and RStudio ([installation tutorial](https://ucrdatacenter.github.io/tutorials/r_install.html)) -->
<!-- * read sections 2.3-2.5, 3.1-3.4, and 4-6 of [A (very) short introduction to R](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/A-very-short-introduction-to-R/blob/master/documents/A%20(very)%20short%20introduction%20to%20R.pdf) -->
<!-- * create a new R project for the Psycholinguistics course  -->
<!-- * install the `tidyverse`, `tidytext` and `childesr` packages -->

<!-- [This video (6:18)](https://vimeo.com/860596815/4a202dd077?share=copy) and [this tutorial](https://ucrdatacenter.github.io/tutorials/r_basics.html) explain the layout of RStudio, how to create a project, and how to install and load packages. -->
<!-- If you have any questions after watching the video and reading the tutorial, please email [datacenter@ucr.nl](mailto:datacenter@ucr.nl) or attend office hours before the workshop. -->

<!-- You can find the workshop handout [here](SCICOGN302_2023h2/workshop1), and additional workshop materials [here](SCICOGN302_2023h2/workshop1extra). -->

<!-- ## Second workshop -->

<!-- The second Data Center workshop takes place on the Friday class of week 5. -->
<!-- It is mandatory for the group working on a data project for their final poster, and optional for the rest of the class. -->

<!-- The case study discussed in the workshop is available [here](SCICOGN302_2023h2/workshop2). -->
