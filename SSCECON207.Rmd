# Introduction

This page collects workshop materials, data sources and supplementary materials for the data-driven assignments in the Spring 2022 edition of International Macroeconomics at UCR.
You can also access the related files directly on [Github](https://github.com/ucrdatacenter/projects/tree/main/SSCECON207/2022h1).

# Working with R and RStudio

## Installing R and RStudio

R is the programming language that you use when working with data.
RStudio is a development environment that makes working with R much more convenient.
Both are free to download and install.

To download R, go to [cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and follow the instructions on the page.
To download RStudio, go to [rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), scroll down and download the file recommended for your operating system.

When installing, you can always stick to the default settings, unless you have different preferences.

In case you get stuck at any point, or would like more guidance in the installation process, feel free to check out any of the following links:

* [Tutorial: Getting Started with R and RStudio](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/tutorial-getting-started-with-r-and-rstudio/)
* [R Tutorial: How to install R and R studio (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Qu7Jg1Jw5A)

# Assignments

## Timeline

* The first Data Center workshop takes place in week 2. It covers the basics of how to create figures in R. You should make sure to have R and RStudio installed before this workshop, and read sections 2, 3.1-3.4, and 4-6 of [A (very) short introduction to R](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/A-very-short-introduction-to-R/blob/master/documents/A\%20(very)\%20short\%20introduction\%20to\%20R.pdf) and sections 1-4 of [How to make any plot in ggplot2?](http://r-statistics.co/ggplot2-Tutorial-With-R.html#6.1\%20Make\%20a\%20time\%20series\%20plot\%20(using\%20ggfortify)).
* The IS-LM poster assignment is due in week 4 of the semester.
* The second Data Center workshop takes place in week 8. It builds on your existing R skills, with a focus on finding and cleaning data.
* The final empirical paper is due at the end of week 15.
* The Data Center student fellows hold office hours every Wednesday between 15:00-19:00 (15:00-17:00 with Tina, 17:00-19:00 with Bianka) on [Zoom](https://universitycollegeroosevelt.zoom.us/j/2831128718?pwd=UmRuSzVqSTZyMndDbDRGSkV5VWFVQT09) to answer questions and help with the poster and paper assignments. You don't need to sign up in advance to attend office hours.
* Additionally, feel free to email Tina (datacenter@ucr.nl) to schedule an individual consultation outside of office hours.
