# Working with R and RStudio

## Installing R and RStudio

R is the programming language that we'll when working with data.
RStudio is a development environment that makes working with R much more convenient.
Both are free to download and install.

To download R, go to [cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and follow the instructions on the page.
To download RStudio, go to [rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), scroll down and download the file recommended for your operating system.

When installing, unless you have different preferences, you can always stick to the default settings.

In case you get stuck at any point, or would like more guidance in the installation process, feel free to check out any of the links below:

# Assignments

## Timeline

* The first Data Center workshop takes place in week 2: during this you will receive guidance on how to create figures in R to complete the IS-LM poster assignment. You should make sure to have R and RStudio installed before this workshop so you can follow along, and to read sections 2, 3.1-3.4 and 4-6 of [A (very) short introduction to R](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/A-very-short-introduction-to-R/blob/master/documents/A\%20(very)\%20short\%20introduction\%20to\%20R.pdf) and sections 1-4 of [How to make any plot in ggplot2?](http://r-statistics.co/ggplot2-Tutorial-With-R.html#6.1\%20Make\%20a\%20time\%20series\%20plot\%20(using\%20ggfortify)).
* The IS-LM poster assignment is due in week 4 of the semester. The Data Center is available for office hours, individual consultations to help with the assignment.
* The second Data Center workshop takes place in week 8. It will build on your existing R skills, with a focus on finding and cleaning data, which will help you in writing your final paper for the course.
* The final empirical paper is due at the end of week 15. In the meantime, the Data Center is available for office hours, individual consultations.
