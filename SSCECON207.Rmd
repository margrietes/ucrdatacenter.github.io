# Introduction

This page collects the workshop materials, data sources and supplementary materials for the data-driven assignments for the Spring 2022 edition of International Macroeconomics at UCR.
You can also access all materials on [Github](https://github.com/ucrdatacenter/projects).

# Working with R and RStudio

## Installing R and RStudio

R is the programming language that we'll use to teach students how to work with data.
RStudio is a development environment that makes working with R much more convenient.
Both are free to download and install.

To download R, go to [cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and follow the instructions on the page.
To download RStudio, go to [rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), scroll down and download the file recommended for your operating system.

When installing, unless you have different preferences, you can always stick to the default settings.

In case you get stuck at any point, or would like more guidance in the installation process, feel free to check out any of the links below:
